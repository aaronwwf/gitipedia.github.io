### Gitipedia is a decentralized free encyclopedia built on top of Github.
<!--
Unlike wikipedia, which is centralized and focus on maintaining knowledge. Gitipedia is decentralized and focus on personal 
imaginations and creations. Not only everyone can edit the articles on Gitipedia, but also can have a version of one's own.
We encourage creativity and diversity, hate authority.    

The idea behind Gitipedia is inspired by the open-source movement from the programing world, we believe creative people
can maintain multiple versions of one article collaboratively. Powered by Git and Github, Gitipedia makes this possible.

Here is the tutorial:

1.Warm up. Learning the basics of Git and Github then create a Github account. That's all.

2.Create an article. Just create a repository with a Readme.md file. And give it a description starts with "gitipedia:)".

3.Edit an article. Fork the the repository you want to edit. Then edit it online or locally.

4.Thumb up an article. "Watch" or "Star" the repository that you like.

5.Publish an article. TBD
